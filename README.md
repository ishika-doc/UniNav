# UniNav – Smart Campus Navigation System

UniNav is a smart campus navigation system designed to help students easily locate buildings, services, and venues within large university campuses.

The project starts with the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and is designed to scale to universities across South Africa.

## Problem
Large university campuses are difficult to navigate, especially for first-year and visiting students. UniNav aims to provide a dedicated, campus-focused navigation experience.

## Status
🚧 In active development – Phase 1 (Wits Campus Directory)
